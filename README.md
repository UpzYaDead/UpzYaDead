## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently, I am looking for a Data Science position.
I just finished my Data Science master in Applied Mathematics, with a thesis on the Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and the Koopman operator.

In my free time, I devote time to:
- Logic puzzles, for example [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/) or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- [Solutions](https://github.com/UpzYaDead/jane_street_puzzles) to some Jane Street puzzles
- Solutions to [AoC 2024](https://github.com/UpzYaDead/AOC_2024)
- Solutions to [AoC 2020](https://github.com/UpzYaDead/AOC2020)
- I have some work done in [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), the software that [3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/videos) uses to animate his videos. Since this work was done in a university, I am not allowed to publish the code or the videos.
